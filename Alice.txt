Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.

Testing the file for branch

This is another example

-> Adding another change into this Alice file.

-> Now, I am making changes into my Alice file, to test the rebase functionality

-> adding another change from the change_alice branch

-> Adding this into my Alice file

-> I'm now adding changes via the git file

-> I'm adding this into the Alice.txt

-> im adding this into the Alice.txt again
